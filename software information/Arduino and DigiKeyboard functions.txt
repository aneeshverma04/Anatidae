Arduino:

pinMode(pinNum,mode)
Configures the specified pin to behave either as an input or an output. 
e.g., pinMode(1,OUTPUT)

digitalWrite(pinNum,HIGH/LOW)
Write a HIGH or a LOW value to a digital pin. Its voltage will be set to the corresponding value: 5V (or 3.3V on 3.3V boards) for HIGH, 0V (ground) for LOW.
e.g., digitalWrite(1,HIGH)

delay(milliseconds)



DigiKeyboard:

DigiKeyboard.delay(milliseconds)
// Better to use this delay while sending key strokes
