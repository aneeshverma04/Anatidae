Arduino:

pinMode(pinNum,mode)
Configures the specified pin to behave either as an input or an output. 
e.g., pinMode(1,OUTPUT)

digitalWrite(pinNum,HIGH/LOW)
Write a HIGH or a LOW value to a digital pin. Its voltage will be set to the corresponding value: 5V (or 3.3V on 3.3V boards) for HIGH, 0V (ground) for LOW.
e.g., digitalWrite(1,HIGH)

delay(milliseconds)



DigiKeyboard:

DigiKeyboard.delay(milliseconds)
// Better to use this delay while sending key strokes

DigiKeyboard.update();
// It is essential that DigiKeyboard.update() is called regularly (the beginning of the loop is good) to maintain USB communication. Using DigiKeyboard.delay() will automatically spam DigiKeyboard.update() calls during the delay period.

DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke:

	DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(num)
	e.g., DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(0)

	DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_whatever)
	e.g., DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_ENTER) 

	DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_whatever, MOD_anyModifier)
	e.g., DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_R, MOD_GUI_LEFT)....Win+R

DigiKeyboard.println("whatever")
// for printing
